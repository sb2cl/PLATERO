% DESCRIPTION
%
% Re-arragnes table for its further use with the toolbox functions.
%
% INPUTS
%
% tableold: table with information to be rearranged.
% colidsjoin: vector with indices of the columns in table_old which have to
% be joined in one varible in the new table.
% colidsrep: vector with indices of the columns in table_old which have to
% be repeated in the new table.
% factorlevels: vector with the Gain levels.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% tablenew: re-arranged table.
