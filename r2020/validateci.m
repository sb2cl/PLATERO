% DESCRIPTION
%
% Calculates the pertentage of observations whose confidence interval
% (C.I.) contains the true observed value.
%
% INPUTS
%
% LowCI: vector with lower limit of the confidence interval for each
% observation.
% UpCI: vector with upper limit of the confidence interval for each
% observation.
% x: vector with true observed values of each observation.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% Percent_in: percentage of observations whose C.I.  contains the true
% observed value.
arguments
   LowCI double
   UpCI double
   x double
end
inci = (x >= LowCI).*(x <= UpCI);
Percent_in = (sum(inci)/length(x))*100;
end
