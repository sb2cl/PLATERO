% DESCRIPTION
%
% Corrects the fluorescence values (F read) eliminating the blank (F BLK)
% and the gain effect.
%
% INPUTS
%
% ymeas: vector with fluorescence (F read) values.
% yblk: vector with fluorescence blank (F BLK) values.
% gain: vector with gain (G) values.
% b1: linear term of the gain effect correction model.
% b2: quadratic term of the gain effect correction model
% scale: optional string or char indicating the scale of the output fector.
% Possible values are ""(default)|"log".
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% ycorr: vector with the corrected falue of fluorescence (F real) for each
% observation.
