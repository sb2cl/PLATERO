% DESCRIPTION
%
% Fits gain effect correction model.
%
% INPUTS
%
% y: vector with fluorescence (F reporter) values already corrected by the
% F BLK. 
% g: vector with gain values at which each observation in y was acquired.
% order: optioanl argument with the order of the expression in the exponent
% term of the gain effect correction model. Default value set to 2.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% B: array with coefficients of the gain effect correction model.

    order = 2;

   vpredict = [vpredict,g.^(i)];
end
for i = 1:size(y,2)
    B(:,i) = pinv(vpredict'*vpredict)*(vpredict'*y(:,i));
end
