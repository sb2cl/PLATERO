% DESCRIPTION
% 
% Fits the terms of the f_G function with the effect of the gain on the
% fluorescence measurements. It assumes the following exponential gain
% effect: F_real = (F_obs - F_BLK)exp(b1*G + b2*G^2. It fits the
% aforementioned expression using 4 data points of the same well and
% repetition, obtainining "size(gfpdata,1)/gain_levels" models. In order to
% prove the assumptions on the coefficients' consistency, an ANOVA analysis
% is carried out on b1 and b2, studying statistically significant
% differcens between concentrations and wells.
%
% INPUTS
%
% ybar: values with contributions
% upieces: values of concentration levels
% colscale: scale of colours
% ff: handle of the barplot with contributions
% bs: bar 
% bw: bar width
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% ff: handle of the barplot with contributions
