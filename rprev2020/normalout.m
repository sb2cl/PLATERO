% DESCRIPTION
%
% Eliminates outlying observations assuming a normal distribution of the
% variable and a type I risk level of alpha.
%
% INPUTS
%
% x: vector observations.
% alpha: optional argument with the type I risk level assumed to compute 
% the threshold value based on the normal distrbution (i.e.: the false
% positive rate). Default value set to 0.05.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% xclean: vector with clean observation.
% outids: logical vector indicating outyling observations.
if nargin == 1
    alpha = 0.05;
end
% Normalization
z = (x-mean(x))/std(x);
cout = norminv(1-alpha/2);
outids = abs(z) > cout;
xclean = x(~outids);
end
