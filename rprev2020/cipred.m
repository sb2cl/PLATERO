% DESCRIPTION
%
% Calculates lower and upper extremes of confidence intervals for the
% predictions in xpred, at a type I risk of alpha, assuming given values of
% the mean squared error and error degrees of freedom.
%
% INPUTS
%
% xpred: vector with predicted values.
% se: value of the estimated standard deviation of the error.
% edf: value of the error degrees of freedom (edf).
% alpha: optional input indicating the type I risk used to calculate the
% confidence intervals. Default value set to 0.05. Must be between 0 and 1.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% LowCI: vector with the lower limit of the confidence interval for each
% observation from xpred.
% UpCI: vector with the upper limit of the confidence interval for each
% observation from xpred.
if nargin == 3
    alpha = 0.05;

    LowCI(i) = xpred(i) - talfa*se2;
    UpCI(i) = xpred(i) + talfa*se2;
