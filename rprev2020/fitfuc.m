% DESCRIPTION
% 
% Fits the coefficients of the f_C function with the conversion from
% corrected fluorescence to concentration.
%
% INPUTS
%
% flu: vector with corrected fluorescence values (F real).
% c_pattern: vector with fluorescein pattern concentration values
% (Concentration).
% intercept: optional input indicating if the intercept term of the model
% should be considered or not. Possible values are 1 (with intercept term)
% and 0 (w.o. intercept). Default value set to 0.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% c: coefficients of the units conversion model.
% mdl: LinearModel object with the information of the calibration
% Fluorescence-Concentration model.

% Measured (flu,x) Real (concpatt,y)
