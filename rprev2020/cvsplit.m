% DESCRIPTION
%
% Provides partition of the data set into a calibration and a validation
% data sub sets. The selection is done on the wells variable, keeping all
% the gains and repetitions of a certain well as part of the training or
% the validation. Both subsets are exluding (they do not repeat wells). The
% calibration percentage is applied stratifying in each concentration.
%
% INPUTS
%
% dataset: table with complete data set.
% calpctge: percentage (0 to 1) of observations to be part of the
% calibration data set.
%
% OUTPUTS
%
% data_cal: table with calibration data set.
% data_val: table with validation data set.
% idcal: index of calibration observations, referred to the original data
% set.
